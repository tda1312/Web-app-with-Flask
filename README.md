# Web-app-with-Flask

_My attempt to build a simple Flask web application **from scartch**_

### Tools

* OS: ubuntu
* Flask
* Python3
* Jinja
* SQLite

### Run
* Open terminal
* Navigate to the application directory
* Python version later than 3.4 is required, as virtual environments are supported natively.
  + <code>python3 -m venv venv
  * In case you dont have one, you can consider installing a third-party tool called virtualenv, then create virtual environment via virtualenv
    + <code>virtualenv venv</code>
* Activate virtual environment
  + <code>source venv/bin/activate</code>
* Run
  + <code>flask run</code>
* Open web browser and access site of your IP address
* Explore the app and enjoy!
